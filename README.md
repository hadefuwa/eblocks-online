## Technologies Used

- **Electron** (^39.2.7) - Desktop application framework
- **Express** (^4.18.2) - Web server for serving frontend and API
- **Monaco Editor** (^0.55.1) - Code editor component (VS Code editor)
- **SerialPort** (^12.0.0) - Serial communication library
- **Arduino CLI** - Bundled for code compilation and upload (v0.35.0)
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **NSIS** - Windows installer creation

## API Endpoints

The app uses a local Express server on port 3000 with the following endpoints:

### Serial Port Management
- `GET /api/ports` - List available serial ports with board detection
- `POST /api/connect` - Connect to serial port
- `POST /api/disconnect` - Disconnect from serial port
- `GET /api/serial/data/:connectionId` - Get serial data (polling)
- `POST /api/serial/send` - Send data to serial port

### Code Upload & Compilation
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload and compile Arduino code, then upload to board

### System Checks
- `GET /api/check-cli` - Check if Arduino CLI is installed and accessible
- `GET /api/check-drivers` - Check if E-Blocks USB drivers are installed
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

### Driver Installation
- `POST /api/install-drivers` - Install E-Blocks USB drivers (tries multiple methods)

## Supported Boards

- ✅ **Arduino Mega** - Full support
- ✅ **ESP32** - Full support
- 🚧 **PIC** - Coming soon

## Driver Installation

The app includes a comprehensive driver installation system for E-Blocks USB drivers:

### Automatic Detection
- **Startup Check**: Automatically checks for installed drivers when the app launches
- **Banner Notification**: Shows a prominent banner at the top of the app if drivers are not installed
- **Periodic Checking**: Rechecks driver status every 30 seconds
- **Auto-Hide**: Banner automatically hides after successful installation

### Installation Methods
The app tries multiple installation methods in order:
1. **Silent Installation**: Attempts silent installation with various flags (`/S`, `/SILENT`, `/VERYSILENT`)
2. **PowerShell Elevation**: If silent methods fail, attempts elevated installation via PowerShell
3. **UI Mode**: Falls back to showing the installer UI if all silent methods fail

### Features
- **Bundled Drivers**: 32-bit and 64-bit driver installers are bundled with the app
- **Flag File**: Creates a `.drivers-installed` flag file after successful installation
- **Board Detection**: Also checks for connected E-Blocks boards as an indirect indicator
- **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and status messages throughout the process

### Manual Installation
If automatic installation fails, you can:
- Click the "Install Drivers" button in the banner or sidebar
- Manually run the installer from `resources/drivers/` in the app installation directory

## Building

### Development
```bash
npm start
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build:win
```

The build process creates:
- Windows installer (NSIS) in `dist-electron/`
- Unpacked application files
- All required resources and dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### COM Port Not Appearing
- **Check Driver Banner**: Look for the orange banner at the top of the app - if visible, drivers need to be installed
- **Install Drivers**: Click the "Install Drivers" button in the banner or sidebar
- **Refresh Ports**: Click the refresh button (↻) after installing drivers
- **Reconnect Board**: Unplug and reconnect your E-Blocks board after driver installation
- **Device Manager**: Check Windows Device Manager to see if the board appears (may show as "Unknown Device" if drivers not installed)

### Upload Fails
- **Board Selection**: Verify the correct board type is selected (Arduino Mega or ESP32)
- **Connection**: Check that the board is connected and the connection status shows "Connected"
- **Arduino CLI**: Ensure Arduino CLI is working (the app bundles it automatically)
- **Code Syntax**: Check for syntax errors in your code
- **Port Access**: Ensure no other application is using the COM port

### Serial Monitor Not Working
- Verify connection status is "Connected"
- Check baud rate matches your code
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
